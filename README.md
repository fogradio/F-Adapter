# (NeurIPS 2025) F-Adapter: Frequency-Adaptive Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Scientific Machine Learning

The code will be officially released as soon as it is properly organized.


## October 17, 2025 Updates 
I am currently focused on the CVPR 2026 submission and on applications for PhD admission in Fall 2026. As a result, organizing and releasing the code in this repository will be delayed slightly. I expect to complete and publish it by November 20, 2025.

Meanwhile, I am actively seeking a PhD position beginning in Fall 2026. If you think we might be a good match, please feel free to contact me.
